# -Digital-Filter-Design-using-MATLAB
An audio file ‘final.wav’ which contains combined and overlapping modified sounds of the
instruments - trumpet, piano, violin, and guitar, has been provided. Another file
‘NonOverlapping.wav’ contains the non-overlapping modified sounds of the musical instruments
– guitar, piano, trumpet, and violin (in this order). The following goals were achieved using MATLAB codes: 
1) The spectrum of each of the instrument’s sounds from ‘NonOverlapping.wav’ is found.
file and the frequency ranges are determined.
2) The spectrum of the combined sound signal from the ‘final.wav’ file is found  and 
the frequency range is determined.
3) A digital filter is designed that would separate the sound of each instrument from
the “final.wav” file. 
4) Each instrument sound is extracted in a separate ‘.wav’ file.
